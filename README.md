    SOLID Programming:

      (S) Single responsibility principle:
            - A class should have one purpose.
      (O) Open/closed principle:
            - Open for extension but closed for modification.
      (L) Liskov substitution principle:
            - Inheritance and Polymorphism: sub/derived types can be used for their base/super class.
      (I) Interface segregation principle:
            - Interfaces
      (D) Dependency Inversion principle:
          - One class does not depend on a specific concrete class. Utilize interfaces.
