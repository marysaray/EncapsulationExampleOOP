# Encapsulation Example OOP: (Object Oriented Programming).
*Overview Module Objectives: Objects & Classes*

    Objectives for this module:

      * Create a program that utilizes objects and classes
      * Create and use a class that demonstrates correct use of encapsulation
      * Create and use a class that demonstrates aggregation or composition
      
    In Practice: Dice Rolling class

    - How can we represent an individual die?
        * Data
        * Functionality
    - What should be public and what should be private?
        * Interacting with the class
    - How should the object be created?
        * How can a valid state be maintained?

## SOLID is an acronym for 5 important design principles

    SOLID Programming:

      (S) Single responsibility principle:
            - A class should have one purpose.
      (O) Open/closed principle:
            - Open for extension but closed for modification.
      (L) Liskov substitution principle:
            - Inheritance and Polymorphism: sub/derived types can be used for their base/super class.
      (I) Interface segregation principle:
            - Interfaces
      (D) Dependency Inversion principle:
          - One class does not depend on a specific concrete class. Utilize interfaces.
